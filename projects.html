                <span> Droplet is my final school project. I worked in Unity with 2 designers. We set out to make an engaging
                        2D puzzle platformer experience. We accomplised our goal creating a functional intuitve 1-hour long experince
                        in just under 20 weeks. As the only programmer for the team meant I had to wear many hats. Working in a 
                        variety of disciplines including AI, sound, animation, player controls, and everything in between. Feel 
                        free to check out the trailer for the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jczNyDv2_4Y&feature=youtu.be">here</a> 
                        or download it and give it a try for yourself <a href="https://github.com/MclSean95/Droplet">here</a>.

                <img name= "right" src="images/SchedulingGA.PNG" height="150" width="220">
                <span> This was my final project in my Artificial Intelligence class. I was tasked with designing a genetic algorithm 
                    that I then had to pitch to my professor. Once I came up with the idea and successfully pitched it, I had to implement 
                    the algorithm. The concept is a scheduling software that considers the number of employees, the shifts that need to be 
                    filled, employee availability, and some other rules such as limiting employeesâ€™ hours and not scheduling employees for 
                    back to back shifts. I created a console application that used a genetic algorithm to create a schedule that fit the criteria
                     listed above. </span>

                <h3>RopeUp (HTML\Node.js\mongoDB)</h3>
                <img name="left" src="images/RopeUp.PNG" height="150" width="220">
                <span>RopeUp was a project that started as an idea to help the community at the rock climbing gym I work at. The problem for some 
                    climbers is to find a partner to climb with so they can climb the higher walls we have. RopeUp is a solution to that problem. 
                    Utilizing Node.JS and mongoDB I created a website that allowed users to enter information about when they would be at the gym. 
                    Using this the app would run a search to other climbers that would be at the gym on similar days and times and allow them to connect.
