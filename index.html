                <span> Droplet is my final school project. I worked in Unity with 2 designers. We set out to make an engaging
                        2D puzzle platformer experience. We accomplised our goal creating a functional intuitve 1-hour long experince
                        in just under 20 weeks. As the only programmer for the team meant I had to wear many hats. Working in a

                <img name= "left" src="images/SchedulingGA.PNG" height="150" width="220">
                <span> This was my final project in my Artificial Intelligence class. I was tasked with designing a genetic algorithm 
                    that I then had to pitch to my professor. Once I came up with the idea and successfully pitched it, I had to implement 
                    the algorithm. The concept is a scheduling software that considers the number of employees, the shifts that need to be 
                    filled, employee availability, and some other rules such as limiting employees’ hours and not scheduling employees for 
                    back to back shifts. I created a console application that used a genetic algorithm to create a schedule that fit the criteria
                     listed above. </span>

                <span>RopeUp was a project that started as an idea to help the community at the rock climbing gym I work at. The problem for some 
                    climbers is to find a partner to climb with so they can climb the higher walls we have. RopeUp is a solution to that problem. 
                    Utilizing Node.JS and mongoDB I created a website that allowed users to enter information about when they would be at the gym. 
                    Using this the app would run a search to other climbers that would be at the gym on similar days and times and allow them to connect.
