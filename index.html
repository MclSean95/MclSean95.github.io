                My name is Sean McLaughlin, and I graduated from New England Institute of Technology in 2019 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Video Game Development & Simulation Technology. After graduation 
                I went on a cross-country road trip exploring the amazing landscapes of the United States. While 
                on the road I had plenty of down time to reflect on what it is I really want to do. I came to realize
                that I want to write code for an awesome company with an affinity for taking programming to the next level. 
                Aside from writing code in my spare time I also am an avid rock climber, skier, and video game player. 
                Since graduating I’ve begun working on multiple side projects including a new game I am creating in Unity, 
                a mobile adaptation of a previous web application I created using Xamarin and Microsoft Azure, and even this 
                portfolio you’re viewing now. Enough about me though go check out some of my work for yourself on the projects
